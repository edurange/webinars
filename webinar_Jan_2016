<h1>Curriculum Development with Hands-on Exercises</h1>

<h2>Begins January 15</h2>
 
<h2>Learning Goals</h2>
Participants will
  <ul>
    <li> Create or revise a 1-term introductory class in Cyber Security</li> 
    <li> Incorporate hands-on exercises as homeworks and labs into their class</li> 
  </ul>
 
<h2>Workshop Description</h2>
We are presenting three webinars on teaching cyber security with hands-on exercises.
Each one is stand-alone but they will be coordinated, so that by the end, the attendees 
will have a set of exercises, notes and other resources to teach a cyber security class in 
the spring.  Different courses emphasize different domains, e.g. networking vs software systems.
We will help you find the right materials for your requirements.
<ul>
  <li> Session 1: Overview of an introductory cyber security class.  We will 
    present some syllabi that we have used for introductory classes.
    This will include our statement of learning objectives,
    lecture notes and exercises.  We will give an overview of some EDURange exercises
    and how they might address some of the learning objectives.
    Topics will include:
    <ul>
      <li> Ethics
      <li> The security mindset</li>
      <li> Access control</li>
      <li> Applied cryptography</li> 
      <li> Models of Security</li>
      <li> Principles of secure system design</li>
      <li> Security evaluation</li> 
    </ul>
  </li> 
  <li> Session 2: An introduction to the EDURange framework for hands-on exercises, and why we
    developed it.
    <ul>
      <li> EDURange has a collection of exercises</li>
      <li> EDURange as a framework for creating hands-on exercises</li>
      <li> Attendees will try one of the exercises that is provided by EDURange</li>
    </ul>
  </li> 
  <li> Session 3: A survey of freely available resources.  There are a number of other resources
  that one can incorporate into a security class.  This session will be driven by the interests of the 
  attendees.
